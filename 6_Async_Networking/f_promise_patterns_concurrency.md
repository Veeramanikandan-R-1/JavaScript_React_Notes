# Promise Patterns and Concurrency (Senior Frontend Engineer Perspective)

Before going deeper into frameworks or libraries, understand this topic as part of real frontend engineering: Promise.all, allSettled, race, any, fan-out, fan-in, and controlled parallelism.

---

# 1. Fundamentals

* Asynchronous code lets applications wait for timers, network, files, and user events without blocking the main thread.
* Promise-based flows should model success, failure, cancellation, and stale responses.
* Reliable networking code handles loading, empty, error, retry, and timeout states.

---

# 2. Core Concepts

| Concept | Practical meaning |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| Task | Macrotask such as timer, user event, or network continuation. |
| Microtask | Promise continuation that runs before the next render opportunity. |
| Promise | Represents eventual success or failure. |
| Cancellation | Stopping work that is no longer needed. |
| Race condition | A bug where timing changes the result. |

---

# 3. Internal Working

* Synchronous code runs to completion before microtasks and later tasks execute.
* Promise callbacks run as microtasks, which can starve rendering if chained heavily.
* Fetch starts browser-managed network work and resolves when response headers are available.

---

# 4. Common Mistakes

* Forgetting `await` inside `try/catch`.
* Letting stale requests overwrite newer results.
* Treating every fetch resolution as successful HTTP status.
* Retrying non-idempotent operations blindly.

---

# 5. Best Practices

* Represent loading, success, empty, and error states explicitly.
* Cancel stale requests when the UI changes.
* Use backoff and idempotency for retries.
* Surface useful errors to users and diagnostics to developers.

---

# 6. Code Example

```js
async function loadDashboard() {
  const [summary, ordersResult, alertsResult] = await Promise.all([
    fetchJson("/api/summary"),
    fetchJson("/api/orders").then(
      (data) => ({ status: "fulfilled", data }),
      (error) => ({ status: "rejected", error })
    ),
    fetchJson("/api/alerts").then(
      (data) => ({ status: "fulfilled", data }),
      (error) => ({ status: "rejected", error })
    ),
  ]);

  return {
    summary,
    orders: ordersResult.status === "fulfilled" ? ordersResult.data : [],
    alerts: alertsResult.status === "fulfilled" ? alertsResult.data : [],
  };
}
```

# 7. Real-world Scenarios

* Cancelling old search requests as the user types.
* Showing a retry button after a network failure.
* Updating a realtime notification count without refreshing the page.

---

# 8. Senior Deep Dive

## When to Use

* Use sequential awaits when order matters and parallel promises when work is independent.
* Use cancellation for typeahead, route changes, and stale requests.
* Use retries only when the operation is safe and the retry improves user experience.

## Debug Checklist

* Log request IDs or timestamps to detect stale responses.
* Check whether `response.ok` is handled separately from network failure.
* Throttle the network and test cancellation, retry, timeout, and offline behavior.

## Code Review Checklist

* Are loading, error, empty, cancelled, and stale states explicit?
* Are retries bounded and idempotency considered?
* Can old responses overwrite newer UI state?


---

# Revision Notes

* Promise Patterns and Concurrency matters because it affects real users, future maintainers, and production behavior.
* Learn the mental model before memorizing syntax.
* Use browser DevTools, tests, and small examples to verify behavior.
* Asynchronous code lets applications wait for timers, network, files, and user events without blocking the main thread.
* Promise-based flows should model success, failure, cancellation, and stale responses.
* Reliable networking code handles loading, empty, error, retry, and timeout states.

# Interview Questions with Answers

### 1. How would you explain Promise Patterns and Concurrency in a real project?

I model async work as explicit states: idle, loading, success, empty, error, cancelled, and stale.

### 2. What happens internally when Promise Patterns and Concurrency is involved?

Promises schedule continuations as microtasks, while timers and user events are tasks. HTTP failures need explicit status handling because fetch does not reject on 4xx/5xx.

### 3. How do you debug issues related to Promise Patterns and Concurrency?

I check request order, cancellation, stale updates, retry rules, idempotency, and how the UI behaves when the network is slow or offline.

### 4. What is the biggest production risk with Promise Patterns and Concurrency?

The biggest risk is building something that works for the demo state but fails with real content, slow networks, accessibility needs, errors, or future changes.

### 5. What should a senior engineer look for in code review?

They should check the mental model, edge cases, accessibility, performance cost, naming, state ownership, test coverage, and whether the simpler native/platform option was considered.

# Hands-on Exercises

## Exercise 1

Implement an async flow related to Promise Patterns and Concurrency.

### Solution

Represent loading, success, empty, error, cancelled, and stale states explicitly.

## Exercise 2

Test with slow network and out-of-order responses.

### Solution

Use request IDs or cancellation so old responses cannot overwrite newer UI.

# Senior Frontend Engineer Takeaway

For senior-level work, Promise Patterns and Concurrency is not only a syntax topic. You should be able to explain the mental model, choose the right pattern for a product requirement, identify common failure modes, and verify behavior through tooling, tests, and browser inspection.
