# Revision Notes: Environment Variables and Build Modes

* Modern frontend tooling improves feedback loops, compatibility, dependency management, and production builds.
* Tooling should serve the product; avoid complexity that the project does not need.
* A senior developer understands both dev-server convenience and production build consequences.
* Best practice: Keep scripts simple and documented.
* Best practice: Use lockfiles.
* Best practice: Run lint, tests, and builds in CI.
* Best practice: Audit dependency size and security before adding libraries.
* Avoid: Installing dependencies without understanding why.
* Avoid: Committing local secrets.
* Avoid: Assuming dev behavior equals production behavior.
* Avoid: Ignoring build warnings.

# Interview Questions with Answers

### 1. Why does Build mode matter in Environment Variables and Build Modes?

Build mode means The environment profile used by the bundler. In interviews, connect it to Environment Variables and Build Modes by explaining the concrete UI behavior, failure state, and tradeoff.

### 2. How does Public variable affect the implementation?

Public variable means A value embedded into client code and visible to users. Implementation depends on ownership, lifecycle, and edge cases, not only naming the API.

### 3. What mistake should you avoid around skipping real edge cases?

Avoid skipping real edge cases. Prefer the simplest reliable approach and verify it with a small example.

### 4. How would you debug a production issue related to Environment Variables and Build Modes?

Reproduce the issue, inspect the relevant state or DOM, and reduce it to a small failing case. Check edge cases, browser behavior, and tests before changing the implementation.

### 5. What would you check in code review for Environment Variables and Build Modes?

Check correctness, edge cases, readability, accessibility, performance, and test coverage. Confirm the chosen approach matches the problem and does not add unnecessary complexity.
