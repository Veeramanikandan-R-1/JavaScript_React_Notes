# Revision Notes: React Interview Questions

* Interview readiness comes from explaining tradeoffs, not reciting definitions.
* Strong answers connect fundamentals to real production consequences.
* Use examples, failure modes, and debugging approaches in every answer.
* Best practice: Start with the mental model.
* Best practice: Give a practical example.
* Best practice: Name tradeoffs.
* Best practice: Mention debugging and tests.
* Best practice: Keep answers concise but concrete.
* Avoid: Answering with definitions only.
* Avoid: Ignoring tradeoffs.
* Avoid: Pretending one tool is always best.
* Avoid: Failing to mention testing and edge cases.

# Interview Questions with Answers

### 1. Why does State ownership matter in React Interview Questions?

State ownership means Choosing the smallest place that should own changing UI data. In interviews, connect it to React Interview Questions by explaining the concrete UI behavior, failure state, and tradeoff.

### 2. How does Rendering model affect the implementation?

Rendering model means React calling components, reconciling output, and committing DOM changes. Implementation depends on ownership, lifecycle, and edge cases, not only naming the API.

### 3. What mistake should you avoid around skipping real edge cases?

Avoid skipping real edge cases. Prefer the simplest reliable approach and verify it with a small example.

### 4. How would you debug a production issue related to React Interview Questions?

Reproduce the issue, inspect the relevant state or DOM, and reduce it to a small failing case. Check edge cases, browser behavior, and tests before changing the implementation.

### 5. What would you check in code review for React Interview Questions?

Check correctness, edge cases, readability, accessibility, performance, and test coverage. Confirm the chosen approach matches the problem and does not add unnecessary complexity.
