# Revision Notes: Playwright End-to-End Tests

* Frontend tests protect user workflows, business rules, and component contracts.
* The best tests resemble how users interact with the app.
* Test strategy should balance confidence, speed, maintenance, and failure clarity.
* Best practice: Test user-visible behavior.
* Best practice: Use accessible queries first.
* Best practice: Keep unit tests fast and E2E tests focused on critical journeys.
* Best practice: Make failures easy to diagnose.
* Avoid: Testing implementation details.
* Avoid: Mocking so much that the test proves nothing.
* Avoid: Skipping accessibility queries.
* Avoid: Having only snapshot tests for interactive behavior.

# Interview Questions with Answers

### 1. Why does Browser flow matter in Playwright End-to-End Tests?

Browser flow means A real user path executed in a browser. In interviews, connect it to Playwright End-to-End Tests by explaining the concrete UI behavior, failure state, and tradeoff.

### 2. How does Locator affect the implementation?

Locator means A resilient way to find elements by role, label, text, or test id. Implementation depends on ownership, lifecycle, and edge cases, not only naming the API.

### 3. What mistake should you avoid around skipping real edge cases?

Avoid skipping real edge cases. Prefer the simplest reliable approach and verify it with a small example.

### 4. How would you debug a production issue related to Playwright End-to-End Tests?

Reproduce the issue, inspect the relevant state or DOM, and reduce it to a small failing case. Check edge cases, browser behavior, and tests before changing the implementation.

### 5. What would you check in code review for Playwright End-to-End Tests?

Check correctness, edge cases, readability, accessibility, performance, and test coverage. Confirm the chosen approach matches the problem and does not add unnecessary complexity.
