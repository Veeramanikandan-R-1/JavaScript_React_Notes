# Interview Questions with Answers

### 1. Why does Scope and closure matter in Async JavaScript Interview Drills?

Scope and closure means How functions remember lexical variables and why that affects callbacks. In interviews, connect it to Async JavaScript Interview Drills by explaining the concrete UI behavior, failure state, and tradeoff.

### 2. How does Event loop affect the implementation?

Event loop means The scheduling model behind synchronous code, microtasks, and timers. Implementation depends on ownership, lifecycle, and edge cases, not only naming the API.

### 3. What mistake should you avoid around skipping real edge cases?

Avoid skipping real edge cases. Prefer the simplest reliable approach and verify it with a small example.

### 4. How would you debug a production issue related to Async JavaScript Interview Drills?

Reproduce the issue, inspect the relevant state or DOM, and reduce it to a small failing case. Check edge cases, browser behavior, and tests before changing the implementation.

### 5. What would you check in code review for Async JavaScript Interview Drills?

Check correctness, edge cases, readability, accessibility, performance, and test coverage. Confirm the chosen approach matches the problem and does not add unnecessary complexity.
