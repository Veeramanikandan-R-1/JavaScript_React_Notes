# Revision Notes: React Router, Routes, and Layouts

* React helps build interactive interfaces from reusable components.
* Modern React is centered on function components, props, state, effects, hooks, and predictable rendering.
* Good React code separates UI state, server state, derived values, effects, and reusable logic.
* Best practice: Keep render pure.
* Best practice: Lift state only when multiple components need it.
* Best practice: Prefer composition over prop tunnels.
* Best practice: Use effects only for synchronization.
* Best practice: Measure before memoizing.
* Avoid: Mutating state directly.
* Avoid: Putting derived state in state unnecessarily.
* Avoid: Using effects for calculations that belong in render.
* Avoid: Using array index keys for reorderable lists.

# Cheat Sheet

| Concept | Practical meaning |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| Component | A reusable piece of UI. |
| Props | Inputs passed from parent to child. |
| State | Data that changes over time and triggers rendering. |
| Effect | Synchronization with systems outside React rendering. |
| Render | Calling components to describe UI. |
| Commit | Applying changes to the host environment such as the DOM. |

# Interview Questions with Answers

### 1. Why does Route hierarchy matter in React Router, Routes, and Layouts?

Route hierarchy means The nested structure that maps URL segments to UI boundaries. In interviews, connect it to React Router, Routes, and Layouts by explaining the concrete UI behavior, failure state, and tradeoff.

### 2. How does Layout route affect the implementation?

Layout route means A shared wrapper that renders child routes through an outlet. Implementation depends on ownership, lifecycle, and edge cases, not only naming the API.

### 3. What mistake should you avoid around skipping real edge cases?

Avoid skipping real edge cases. Prefer the simplest reliable approach and verify it with a small example.

### 4. How would you debug a production issue related to React Router, Routes, and Layouts?

Reproduce the issue, inspect the relevant state or DOM, and reduce it to a small failing case. Check edge cases, browser behavior, and tests before changing the implementation.

### 5. What would you check in code review for React Router, Routes, and Layouts?

Check correctness, edge cases, readability, accessibility, performance, and test coverage. Confirm the chosen approach matches the problem and does not add unnecessary complexity.
