# Revision Notes: Virtualization and Large Lists

* Frontend performance is user experience.
* Measure before optimizing, then fix the bottleneck closest to user pain.
* Performance includes network, JavaScript, rendering, images, fonts, server timing, and interaction responsiveness.
* Best practice: Measure with DevTools, Lighthouse, React Profiler, and real-user metrics.
* Best practice: Set budgets for images, fonts, and JavaScript.
* Best practice: Defer non-critical work.
* Best practice: Optimize the biggest bottleneck first.
* Avoid: Optimizing random code without profiling.
* Avoid: Shipping huge bundles for rarely used routes.
* Avoid: Animating layout-heavy properties.
* Avoid: Ignoring low-end devices and slow networks.

# Interview Questions with Answers

### 1. Why does Conditional branch matter in Virtualization and Large Lists?

Conditional branch means Choosing which UI to render from current state. In interviews, connect it to Virtualization and Large Lists by explaining the concrete UI behavior, failure state, and tradeoff.

### 2. How does Stable key affect the implementation?

Stable key means A persistent identity for each item in a changing list. Implementation depends on ownership, lifecycle, and edge cases, not only naming the API.

### 3. What mistake should you avoid around skipping real edge cases?

Avoid skipping real edge cases. Prefer the simplest reliable approach and verify it with a small example.

### 4. How would you debug a production issue related to Virtualization and Large Lists?

Reproduce the issue, inspect the relevant state or DOM, and reduce it to a small failing case. Check edge cases, browser behavior, and tests before changing the implementation.

### 5. What would you check in code review for Virtualization and Large Lists?

Check correctness, edge cases, readability, accessibility, performance, and test coverage. Confirm the chosen approach matches the problem and does not add unnecessary complexity.
