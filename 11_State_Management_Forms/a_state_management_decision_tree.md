# State Management Decision Tree (Senior Frontend Engineer Perspective)

Before going deeper into frameworks or libraries, understand this topic as part of real frontend engineering: choosing between local state, context, reducers, stores, and server cache.

---

# 1. Fundamentals

* React helps build interactive interfaces from reusable components.
* Modern React is centered on function components, props, state, effects, hooks, and predictable rendering.
* Good React code separates UI state, server state, derived values, effects, and reusable logic.

---

# 2. Core Concepts

| Concept | Practical meaning |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| Component | A reusable piece of UI. |
| Props | Inputs passed from parent to child. |
| State | Data that changes over time and triggers rendering. |
| Effect | Synchronization with systems outside React rendering. |
| Render | Calling components to describe UI. |
| Commit | Applying changes to the host environment such as the DOM. |

---

# 3. Internal Working

* React render should stay pure: same inputs should describe the same UI.
* State updates schedule a re-render; React compares the new element tree with the previous tree and commits necessary DOM changes.
* Effects run after commit and should synchronize with external systems such as subscriptions, timers, network, or imperative widgets.

---

# 4. Common Mistakes

* Mutating state directly.
* Putting derived state in state unnecessarily.
* Using effects for calculations that belong in render.
* Using array index keys for reorderable lists.
* Optimizing with memoization before measuring.

---

# 5. Best Practices

* Keep render pure.
* Lift state only when multiple components need it.
* Prefer composition over prop tunnels.
* Use effects only for synchronization.
* Measure before memoizing.

---

# 6. Code Example

```jsx
function EmptyState({ title, action }) {
  return (
    <section aria-labelledby="empty-title">
      <h2 id="empty-title">{title}</h2>
      {action}
    </section>
  );
}

export default function OrdersPage({ orders }) {
  if (orders.length === 0) {
    return <EmptyState title="No orders yet" action={<button>Create order</button>} />;
  }

  return orders.map((order) => <article key={order.id}>{order.name}</article>);
}
```

---

# 7. Real-world Scenarios

* A component re-renders because parent state changed.
* A list has wrong input values because keys are unstable.
* An effect keeps refetching because dependencies are unstable.

---

# 8. Senior Deep Dive

## When to Use

* Use local state for local UI, context for scoped shared values, server-state tools for remote cache, and global stores for truly cross-cutting client state.
* Use effects for synchronization with external systems, not for derived render calculations.
* Use composition before adding global state.

## Debug Checklist

* Use React DevTools to inspect props, state, owners, and render causes.
* Check keys, effect dependencies, stale closures, and state mutation.
* Profile before adding memoization.

## Code Review Checklist

* Is state owned by the smallest sensible component?
* Are effects necessary and cleaned up?
* Are data fetching states and accessibility states complete?

# Revision Notes

* State Management Decision Tree matters because it affects real users, future maintainers, and production behavior.
* Learn the mental model before memorizing syntax.
* Use browser DevTools, tests, and small examples to verify behavior.
* React helps build interactive interfaces from reusable components.
* Modern React is centered on function components, props, state, effects, hooks, and predictable rendering.
* Good React code separates UI state, server state, derived values, effects, and reusable logic.

# Interview Questions with Answers

### 1. How do you decide where state should live in a React app?

Start local. Lift state when siblings need it, use context for scoped shared values, use server-state tools for remote data, and use a global store for cross-cutting client state that many unrelated areas need.

### 2. What is the difference between client state and server state?

Client state is owned by browser interaction, such as open panels or unsaved form input. Server state is remote data that needs fetching, caching, invalidation, refetching, and stale-data handling.

### 3. When is global state a bad choice?

It is bad when the state is local, temporary, or only shared by nearby components. Global state makes ownership less obvious and can create unnecessary rerenders, stale data, and harder tests.

### 4. What is duplicated derived state, and why is it risky?

It stores a value that can be calculated from other state, such as totals, filtered lists, or selected labels. The copies can drift, leading to effects that only exist to synchronize state that should have been derived.

### 5. What state-management issues do you flag in review?

State owned too high, global stores for local UI, duplicated server data, effects used for synchronization, unclear update ownership, and selectors that subscribe components to more state than they need.

# Hands-on Exercises

## Exercise 1

Create a React component that demonstrates State Management Decision Tree.

### Solution

Include props, state or effects only when needed, stable keys for lists, and visible loading/error/empty states where relevant.

## Exercise 2

Review the component with React DevTools.

### Solution

Inspect props, state ownership, render behavior, effect dependencies, and accessibility names.

# Senior Frontend Engineer Takeaway

For senior-level work, State Management Decision Tree is not only a syntax topic. You should be able to explain the mental model, choose the right pattern for a product requirement, identify common failure modes, and verify behavior through tooling, tests, and browser inspection.
